# PrettyCoolFinalProject
Final project for CSCE155N

Instructions:
1. Use literature to find the critical temperature and critical pressure in Kelvin and Pascals for your desired gas.

2. Insert the values found into the corresponding edit boxes.

3. Find the specific Volume of the sample of your gas in m^3/mol.

4. Insert the value found into the corresponding edit box.

5. If solving for pressure, insert a valid temperature in Kelvin into the temperature edit box.

6. If solving for temperature, insert a valid pressure in pascals in the pressure edit box.

7. Press the corresponding calculate button to run the calculation.

Test cases:
1. Inserting an invalid value into any of the boxes results in a message box appearing with the corresponding error message.

2. Example calculation:
Methyl chloride has a critical pressure of 6667185 Pa and a critical Temperature of 416.1 K. The specific volume of the example is 0.00063m^3/mol. The temperature is 300K. Inserting all of these values into the corresponding boxes and pressing calculate on the pressure side should yield 2505429.6192 Pa. Inserting the specific volume again and the found pressure from the previous calculation, after pressing calculate, a final temperature of 300 K should be found. This makes sense because it is the same equation but solved for temperature instead of pressure.
